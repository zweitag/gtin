== DESCRIPTION:

The GTIN gem provides very simple functionality for verifying checksums on EAN-13 and UPC-A barcode values.
It also does very simple conversion between the two by left-padding with zeroes.  This is not intended to 
be a complex gem, but is certainly functional for applications that require that barcode values be
checked for valid checksums and length.

Inspired by the EAN gem by Pascal Belloncle (nano RAILS)
